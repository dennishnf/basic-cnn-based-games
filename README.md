Basic CNN-based games
=====================

Some basic CNN-based games controlled by hand poses. Both systems work in real-time. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained using Caffe framework. OpenCV libraries were used. In order to obtain a better computation performance, the system was implemented using C++ language. The systems are intended to work on Linux systems, however, can be compiled for Windows or other Operating System.

Here, two games are presented:

- Musical instruments game. [[demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DilmBQpA9iw)]

- Yan Ken Po game. [[demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L42mliEAv3w)]

In order to modify the code, you should compile with:

```
$ make
```

Finally, execute the created file. Example:

```
$ ./yankenpo
```
